#+Title: C++ Multi-threading
#+AUTHOR: Nelson Rodrigues


Modern C++ adds new functions/options to deal with threads independent of Operating System. Lots of ideas we could talk about this topic, it's very important to know some techniques using threads. A simple network program with a GUI that is constantly listen for data, couldn't work properly without threads

Concepts/ideas:

- Thread management: Threads, locks, dead locks, ...
- Communication between threads: Conditions variables, features, ...
- Atomic Operations, Lock free data structures, ...
- Models/Architectures: One writer and multiple readers, ....


** Qt - Worker Thread

The follow example uses Qt polemic thread management to describe a [[https://github.com/NelsonBilber/Qt/tree/master/WorkerQueue][Worker Queue]]  


** std::future and std::promise
