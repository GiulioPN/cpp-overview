* Stack of Development 

It's important to establish a pipeline for development, C++ has plenty of tools to deal with this process.
These are my weapons of choice:

- Project organization: [[https://cmake.org/][Cmake]]
- IDE: Emacs, Qt Creator
- Unit Test (TDD, BDD): [[https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2][Catch2]] or [[https://github.com/google/googletest][Google Test]]
- Fuzz Testing: [[https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html][libFuzzer]]
- Continuous Integration: [[https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/cpp/][Travis CI]]   
- Static Analysis: [[http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/][Cpp Check]]

*** Use cases

Follow /Work In Progress (WIP) / [[https://github.com/NelsonBilber/algorithms][Algorithms]] I'm trying to apply these concepts.

On other project [[https://github.com/NelsonBilber/cpp.unittests][C++ Unit Tests]] I have used Google-Tests for TDD and Travis for Continuous Integration
